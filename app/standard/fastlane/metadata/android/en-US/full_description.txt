<i>Translate You</i> is a Translator App built with <a href="https://m3.material.io/">Material Design 3 (You)</a> supporting different translation engines. Supported engines are <a href="https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate">LibreTranslate</a>, which supports more than 30 languages and <a href="https://github.com/thedaviddelta/lingva-translate">LingvaTranslate</a> which uses Google Translate as a backend, thus causing the NonFreeNet anti-feature.

There's also a <a href="https://apt.izzysoft.de/packages/com.bnyro.translate/">libre version</a> of the app which refrains from using Lingva and therefore doesn't have the anti-feature.
